# Calgary Trees — Condition and Appraised Value

## Dataset
This visualization uses City of Calgary data on municipally managed trees, including location, assessed condition, and appraised value.

The view focuses on trees located within Confederation Golf Course.

## Analysis Focus
I was interested in understanding how tree condition and appraised value vary spatially within a single managed area.

By limiting the scope to one location, the visualization emphasizes local variation rather than city-wide trends, making patterns easier to interpret.

## Visualization

### Tree Condition and Value Map
This map displays individual trees within Confederation Golf Course.

- Color represents tree condition  
- Point size represents appraised tree value  

The map allows both variables to be compared simultaneously while showing how condition and value vary across the site.

## Notes on Interpretation
This visualization is descriptive and intended for spatial comparison within the selected area rather than valuation or management decision-making.
