# Alberta Breeding Birds — Interactive Tableau Dashboard

## Dataset
This dashboard uses data on breeding bird pair counts across Alberta, including species, geographic region, and season.

While the dataset contains multiple bird species, the analysis focuses on the Gray Jay.

## Analysis Focus
The goal of this dashboard was to explore how a single species is distributed across Alberta and how its presence varies across regions and seasons.

The Gray Jay was chosen due to its wide geographic range and adaptability, making it a good example for illustrating spatial and seasonal variation in breeding bird data. Focusing on one species allowed the dashboard to tell a clearer, more interpretable story rather than presenting all species simultaneously.

## Dashboard Design
This interactive Tableau dashboard combines multiple coordinated views:

- A map showing the geographic distribution of Gray Jay breeding pairs across Alberta  
- A regional comparison highlighting differences between northern, central, and southern Alberta  
- A seasonal view showing how recorded breeding pairs vary throughout the year  

Interactions such as filtering and highlighting allow selections in one view to update the others, supporting exploratory analysis across geography and time.

## Dashboard Walkthrough Video
Because this dashboard relies on interactivity, a short walkthrough video is provided demonstrating how the views respond to user input and how the dashboard was intended to be explored.

## Notes on Interpretation
This dashboard is exploratory and intended to support comparison and pattern recognition rather than formal population assessment.
