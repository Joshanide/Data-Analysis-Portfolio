# Tableau Visualizations

This folder contains data visualizations created in Tableau. Most visuals are presented as static charts; one project includes an interactive dashboard demonstrated via a short video walkthrough.

The visualizations are based on the following datasets:

- **River Water Quality**  
  Exploratory visuals examining heavy metal levels, dissolved oxygen, and water quality guideline compliance across river monitoring sites.

- **Calgary Trees**  
  A spatial visualization showing tree condition and appraised value within a managed urban site.

- **Alberta Breeding Birds**  
  A Tableau dashboard built around breeding pair observations across Alberta. While the dataset includes multiple species, the dashboard focuses on the Gray Jay to illustrate seasonal and regional patterns.  
  An interactive walkthrough of this dashboard is provided via a linked video in the project’s README.

Each dataset has its own subfolder with a README describing the analysis focus and displaying the associated visualizations, so charts can be reviewed directly without navigating through individual files.
