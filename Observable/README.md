# Observable Visualizations

This folder contains data visualizations created in Observable using cell-by-cell JavaScript code. The original visuals were built as interactive notebooks; this repository includes static screenshots for review and documentation purposes.

The visualizations are based on two primary datasets:
- **Steam Games**: Exploratory charts examining game categories, genres, and review scores.
- **Billboard Hot 100**: Visualizations exploring artist performance, chart longevity, and audio-related trends over time.

Each dataset has its own subfolder with a README that describes the analysis focus and displays the associated visualizations, so charts can be reviewed directly without navigating through every file.
