## Analysis Focus
I was interested in understanding how artists perform on the Billboard Hot 100 over time, with particular attention to chart longevity, sustained success at top positions, and how patterns of chart performance have changed across eras.

## Visualizations

### Main Insights

#### Top Artists by Time at #1
This horizontal bar chart ranks artists by the total number of weeks their songs spent at the #1 position on the Billboard Hot 100.

This visualization provides a clear and interpretable comparison of sustained peak chart success, highlighting which artists have maintained the longest cumulative presence at the top of the chart.

#### Changes in Chart Longevity Over Time
This line chart shows how long songs tend to remain on the Billboard Hot 100 across different time periods.

Rather than focusing on individual songs, the visualization highlights broader trends in chart longevity, providing context on how the lifespan of charting songs has evolved over time.

### Additional Exploration

#### Exploring Audio Trends Across Decades
This radar chart visualizes energy, danceability, and happiness for songs on the Billboard Hot 100 across different decades.

It is intended as an exploratory visualization that highlights broad trends rather than precise, statistically validated findings. For example, we can observe that energy and happiness tend to peak around the 2000s, suggesting that pop hits during that era were, on average, more energetic and upbeat.

While these patterns are interesting, this chart is best interpreted as contextual and exploratory, complementing more standard visualizations rather than serving as a primary analytical conclusion.
