# Data Visualization Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of data visualizations created using Tableau, Observable (JavaScript), and Datawrapper. The projects focus on exploring real-world datasets through clear visual design, exploratory analysis, and effective communication of patterns and trends.

## Recommended Starting Points

I recommend starting with the following projects:

- **Billboard Hot 100 (Observable)**  
  Interactive-style visual analysis of chart longevity, artist performance, and audio-related trends over time.  
  _Observable → BillboardTop100_

- **Alberta Breeding Birds Dashboard (Tableau)**  
  A focused dashboard centered on the Gray Jay, showing regional and seasonal patterns across Alberta, with an accompanying video walkthrough demonstrating interactivity.  
  _Tableau → AlbertaBreedingBirds_
  
  **Watch the dashboard walkthrough:**

- **Steam Games Market Analysis (Observable)**  
  Exploratory visuals examining genres, categories, and the relationship between critic and user review scores.  
  _Observable → SteamGames_

## Tools and Platforms

- **Tableau** – Static charts and one interactive dashboard (demonstrated via video)
- **Observable** – Cell-by-cell JavaScript visualizations
- **Datawrapper** – Clean, publication-style charts
- **Excel / CSV** – Data cleaning and preparation

## Repository Structure

- **/observable**  
  JavaScript-based visualizations created in Observable. Each dataset has its own subfolder with a README describing the analysis focus and displaying the visuals.

- **/tableau**  
  Visualizations created in Tableau, including static charts and one interactive dashboard with a linked video walkthrough.

- **/datawrapper**  
  A publication-style visualization created in Datawrapper, with supporting context and interpretation.

Each subfolder includes a README so visualizations can be reviewed directly without navigating through individual files.
