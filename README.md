# Data-Analysis-Portfolio

This repository contains selected data analysis and visualization projects demonstrating my ability to clean data, explore trends, and communicate insights through clear and effective visualizations.

The projects primarily draw from coursework in CPSC 482 (Data visualization Fundamentals) and focus on translating data into actionable insights using industry-standard tools.
