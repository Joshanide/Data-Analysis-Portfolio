# Study Permits Issued to Low-Income Countries (2021–2024)

## Analysis Focus
I was interested in understanding how Canadian study permits are distributed across low-income countries worldwide, and whether there are noticeable regional patterns in where permits are being issued.

Rather than focusing on year-to-year changes, this visualization aggregates data from 2021 to 2024 to provide a broader view of study permit distribution by country.

## Visualization

### Study Permits by Country
This choropleth map displays the total number of Canadian study permits issued to students from low-income countries over the selected period.

Countries are shaded based on permit counts, allowing for quick comparison across regions. Numeric labels are included for countries with notable totals to provide additional context without requiring interaction.

**Visualization created using Datawrapper.**

## Notes on Interpretation
This visualization is descriptive and intended to provide a high-level overview of study permit distribution by country. Permit counts do not account for population size, application volume, or approval rates, which may affect cross-country comparisons.

The chart is designed to support pattern recognition and geographic comparison rather than causal analysis.
